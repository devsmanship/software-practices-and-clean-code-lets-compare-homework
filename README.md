# Software practices and clean code - Let's compare homework

This repository is for homework part of a course called [*Software practices and clean code*](http://bit.ly/software-practices-12-99-march).

It's a simple obfuscated class. You need to refactor it twice. Before and after you take the course. After that you can compare the two solutions *you* wrote and see what you've learned.
